A personal website that gives a brief summary for career path of Indian students passing Xth.

This is a personal website meant to educate myself upon UI designing and specifically getting familiar with [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3) framework while also having a practical approach to help the students of India.

##Note

This site does not contain the most efficient, updated, researched or even the most reliable info, it is only meant to be used as a  reference. It was merely to sharpen my UI skills for now, but I'll try to host one with detailed research and better functionalities with more focus on practical approach, later.
